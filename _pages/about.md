I’m an Environmental Engineer from the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina (Perú) as well as a Master of Environmental Management from Yale School of Environment (US) with over 9 years of professional experience in environmental and sustainability policy with an expertise leveraging data science, intersectoral collaboration, and systems thinking for multidimensional problem solving. My work experience includes both private and public sector working primarily in the LAC Region in Perú, Bolivia, as well as experiences in Colombia, Mexico, Dominican Republic, some others Latin American countries.

Passionate on open information and metrics to evaluate the impact of a policies and projects which is why I have heavily focused in the integration of data science in environmental analysis, policy, knowledge management and project management to help stakeholders become more effective in voicing their concerns and fully engage in adressing relevant development issues.
