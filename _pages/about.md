I’m an Environmental Engineer from the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina (Perú) as well as a Master of Environmental Management from Yale School of Environment (US) with over 9 years of professional experience in environmental and sustainability policy with an expertise in leveraging data science, intersectoral collaboration, and systems thinking for multidimensional problem solving primarily in the LAC Region (Perú, Bolivia, Colombia, Mexico, Dominican Republic). I'm an advocate on the importance on open information and methods to analyze environmental and development issues which is why I have heavily focused in the integration of data science in environmental analysis, policy, knowledge management and project management to provide state of the art quantitative and qualitative analysis but also help stakeholders become more effective in voicing their concerns and fully engage in adressing them.
