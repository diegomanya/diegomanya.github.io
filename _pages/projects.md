During my professional and academic experience I have contributed to multiple sustainable, and environmental and policy initiatives using different analytical frameworks and tools suited for the objectives of the intervention. Several of them of them are based in the tools and principles of data science, open data and collaboration. Below are some of the most relevant examples of my work applied in projects and consulting engagements in sustainability and environmental policy, projects and research.

## Supporting the formulation of the Colombian National Electric Mobility Strategy

As part of a collaboration with relevant actors supporting the elaboration of a national electric mobility strategy for Colombia, I analyzed barriers and possible best practices to successfully promote the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EV) in the country focusing in the adoption of private EV and associate recharging infrastructure. The analysis involved through review of the regulations and state of the energy market in Colombia to evaluate their effects in the cost of Private and Public Recharge of EV through a quantitative analysis. In addition, I identify best practices such as incentives and tax reforms from other regions to address some of the most relevant barriers and leverage promising conditions, and proposed some short, medium and long term recommendations to promote the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EV) in Colombia ![](/images/projects/EV_Privada_Recarga_Costo.png | width="315") ![](/images/projects/EV_Publica_Recarga_Costo.png | width="315")

## Vulnerability Analysis of the Ica River Basin: A Water Risk Analysis from a Livelihoods Perspective

Report analyzing the vulnerability of the Ica River Basin to water related natural risks based in the sustainable livelihood's framework. The report included a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the risk of the region including the nature of the risk, the potential impacts to vulnerable communities' livelihoods, the role of the structure of the local government in relation to risks reduction, and recommendations for addressing the topic from a holistic perspective.

## Carbon Offsets and Health Co-Benefits: Assessing the Capacity of the Offset Program to Provide Health Co-benefits to California's Disadvantaged Communities

Report analyzing the existing carbon offset program, part of California's Cap-and-Trade program, to evaluate whether this system can be modified to deliver co-benefits, particularly health co-benefits, to Disadvantaged Communities in California. The report included focused in the governance aspects of the program, highlighting issues around Data Transparency and Community Engagement; as well as analyzing specific Offset Protocols including Urban Forestry, Carbon Farming, Water-Energy Nexus, among others.

## Statistical and Geospatial analysis of 10 years of Water Quality Data for the Titicaca, Desaguadero, Poopo and Salar de Coipasa (TDPS) System

of Peru and Bolivia as part of a large-scale environmental analysis. This work took around 3 weeks, including consultation with partners, and included all the process of data science including framing the issues and understanding the questions the client needed to be answered, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, modelling, and deployment of a dashboard and programmatically generated visualizations. Most of the work was performed using R particularly for data cleaning, modelling, feature engineering, and visualization, although I also required to use Python to perform geospatial analysis and plotting in GIS software, and Power BI to create and deploy a dashboard for interactive use for internal clients of the project. This process allowed me to analyse over 130,000 records of water quality data from 2010 to 2020 to provide meaningful insights to the partners of the Project about the state of the water in the binational watershed through exploratory analysis, time series and geospatial analysis, which served as fundamental basis for more refined descriptive analysis and association with other environmental information. In addition, the process also included the programmatic plotting of over 300 graphs and maps which represented important aspects of water quality for different actors including identifying significant trends, spatial association with other features and most relevant environmental transgressions. Finally, the process also included developing a dashboard for internal use for the partners of the project, which would help them analyse the data interactively and focused on particular features or areas depending on their interest.
