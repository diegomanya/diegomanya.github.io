During my professional and academic experience I have contributed to multiple sustainable, and environmental and policy initiatives using different analytical frameworks and tools suited for the objectives of the intervention. Several of them of them are based in the tools and principles of data science, open data and collaboration. Below are some of the most relevant examples of my work applied in projects and consulting engagements in sustainability and environmental policy, projects and research.

## Statistical and Geospatial analysis of 10 years of Water Quality Data for the Titicaca, Desaguadero, Poopo and Salar de Coipasa (TDPS) System (2022)

As part of the development of the [Transboundary Diagnostic Assessment (TDA)](https://iwlearn.net/manuals/tda-sap-methodology) for the TDPS System between Peru and Bolivia, I analyzed over 130,000 records of water quality data from 2010 to 2020 to provide meaningful insights about the state of the water in the binational watershed through exploratory analysis, time series and geospatial analysis, an creating interactive dashboards which served as fundamental basis for more refined descriptive analysis and association with other environmental information. The process allowed me to identify the presence of relevant environmental pressures to water quality, such as wastewater discharge, deficient solid waste management, informal mining, natural conditions and others, across 13 watershed of the TDPS System using information about economic activities, applicable standards and effluent information.

## Framework to analyze environmental and income inequality using econometric tools (2018-2021)

One of my most relevant contributions to the [Urban Environment and Social Inclusion Index (UESI)](https://datadrivenlab.org/urban) Project was the implementation of econometric indices for inequality applied to the spatial distribution of environmental benefits and hazards to the citizens in relation to income. Building on previous studies, I proposed the use and implemented the pipeline of the Environmental Concentration Curves and index to represent the distribution of environmental variables, which in conjunction with Lorenz Curve and the Gini Index served to to create a four-quadrant typology which served to identify that cities are not sharing environmental benefits and burdens equally given that 95 of the 162 cities included in the UESI are burdening lower-income populations with poor air quality, exposure to urban heat, and lack of access to tree cover and public transport. Later, I contributed in the implementation of the pipeline and analysis using the Kolmâ€“Pollak Equally-Distributed Equivalent (KP EDE) inequality index to analyze inequality in the distribution of Urban Heat Island between multiple population groups which showed that the distribution of UHI intensity is worse for both people of color and the poor, compared to white and wealthier populations in nearly all major US cities.

## Developing training to mainstream of SDG's in national policy documents and international cooperation portfolios (2018)

I analyzed and provided training related to the alignment of the Sustainable Development Goals including their targets with national and regional policy documents and cooperation portfolios using the [Rapid Integrated Assessment Tool](https://www.undp.org/publications/rapid-integrated-assessment). I used the RIA to analyze the alignment between each SDG and the objectives and targets of the most relevant policy documents through the identification of key terms and themes and assess whether the policy objectives were entirely or partially aligned to the SDGS. Furthermore, based on the initial qualitative analysis, I aggregated the results to identify policy gaps related to some SDG's or pillars of development (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnerships) and provided policy recommendations to address them.

## Supporting the formulation of the Colombian National Electric Mobility Strategy (2018)

I analyzed the barriers and possible best practices to successfully promote the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EV) in the country focusing in the adoption of private EV and associated recharging infrastructure. The analysis involved a thorough review of the regulations and state of the energy market in Colombia to evaluate their effects in the cost of Private and Public Recharge of EV through a quantitative analysis. In addition, I identified best practices such as incentives and tax reforms from other regions to address some of the most relevant barriers and leverage promising conditions, and proposed some short, medium and long term recommendations to promote the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EV) in Colombia.

## Vulnerability Analysis of the Ica River Basin: A Water Risk Analysis from a Livelihoods Perspective (2018)

In the aftermath of ENSO event of 2017, I, in collaboration with other colleague, analyzed the vulnerability of the Ica River Basin to water related natural risks using the [sustainable livelihoods framework](https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/migration/latinamerica/UNDP_RBLAC_Livelihoods-Guidance-Note_EN-210July2017.pdf) which included a quantitative and qualitative analysis of Natural, Economic, Human and Physical Capital and the effects of the floods of 2017 based in field visits and secondary information from multiple sources including environmental and socioeconomic datasets. In addition I proposed recommendations to reduce water related risks addressing the issues identified in each type of capital as well as broader institutional recommendations to enhance resilience and institutional capacity.

## Case Study on the integration of environmental variables in socioeconomic development analysis and strategies (2017)
I developed a Proof of Concept for the inclusion of environmental data such as Pollution, Climate, Built Environment, Natural Spaces, and other spatially explicit data complementing the [Combos Approach](https://sdgintegration.undp.org/combos-approach) a UNDP's framework that leverage already developed social and economic data used primarily poverty reduction initiatives. I proposed a conceptual approach for upscaling or downscaling environmental data for proper integration with other dataset and performed a Case Study analyzing the causal links between Urban Heat Islands and other relevant social and economic indicators in the city of Sao Paulo. The methodological considerations and results were presented in a regional training on tools for achieving SDGs.

## Carbon Offsets and Health Co-Benefits: Assessing the Capacity of the Offset Program to Provide Health Co-benefits to California's Disadvantaged Communities (2017)

In collaboration with other colleagues, I analyzed the existing carbon offset program, part of California's Cap-and-Trade program, to evaluate whether this system can be modified to deliver co-benefits, particularly health co-benefits, to Disadvantaged Communities in California identifying issues around Data Transparency of the whole program and the severe limitations of Urban Forestry projects. Based on this results I proposed recommendations to the program and updates to the Urban Forestry Protocol to increase the impact of the program, however, I also identified several limitations and potentials conflicts that put into question whether the Offset Program is compatible with the goal of providing co-benefits to disadvantaged communities in California. 

## System Dynamics Model of the relation between Health Outcomes and Climate Change in Sao Paulo (2017)

Building in previous work and in collaboration with a colleague, I developed a Systems Dynamics Model to analyze the complex relations between Urban Heat Island, Climate Change and relevant Health Outcomes particularly the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases such as Dengue, in the city of Sao Paulo. The model was developed using Vensim and trained using 10 year monthly data of environmental variables, built environment, population and hospital data, and due to their complex and reinforcing nature of the variables the results indicated that over the next 50 years there could be an importance increase the incidence of Dengue and Cardiac conditions in people over age of 65 in the city of Sao Paulo.
